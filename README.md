# About The Code

I've lost all the documentation related to this project, so the only way to know how to compile and run the program properly is by inspecting the code.

Even though, the project should be complete, being version [**P8**](P8) the latest one.

In the [**example_files**](example_files) directory are some files that should be enough to run the latest version of the program.
